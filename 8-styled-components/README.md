The component is styled using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) themes. This means the component only works when wrapped inside the `ThemeProvider` context.

> Note that the value of testing style output is unclear. The purpose of this test is merely to illustrate how to use ThemeProvider in tests.
