## Dear friend,

Writing and presenting these tests took a lot of work. I hope it will make your life easier!

### Working tests

The test examples run in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/skidding/react-testing-examples) and this searchable library is generated from README and test files [available on GitHub](https://github.com/skidding/react-testing-examples). This is convenient and cool!

### Opinionated tests

1.  The tests lean towards _integration_ tests. Personally, I believe any decorated component is a _unit_, because we intend to reuse it as a whole. Read [Testing React Components](https://medium.com/@skidding/testing-react-components-30516bc6a1b3) for more on this.

2.  Using [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/) and optionally [React Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos). This project promotes Cosmos' Testing API, but always offers a plain alternative for people who aren't interested.

These examples should be useful even if you don't share the same opinions, and I welcome everyone to share ideas for growing this repository.

Love,<br/>
