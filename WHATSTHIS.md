## Dear friend,

Presenting these examples took work. I hope they'll make your life easier!

### Why put this together?

There's a lot of wisdom that goes into writing clean tests. With every project I learn something new. I wanted to document my latest testing style and use it as a go-to resource for future projects.

### How does it work?

The test examples are up to date and run in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/skidding/react-testing-examples). This searchable library is generated from README and test files [available on GitHub](https://github.com/skidding/react-testing-examples/tree/master/tests).

### Is this useful to you?

The testing examples are _opinionated_. They aim to mimic user behavior and avoid testing abstract components. But you're free to disagree with [my testing philosophy](https://medium.com/@skidding/testing-react-components-30516bc6a1b3). The examples also feature modern libraries and agnostic testing techniques.

### What's the focus?

_The component setup_. Performing actions and assertions is already well documented by the tools that handle event simulation and/or expectations. The examples here focus on how to wire up various component types for testing.

### Want to contribute?

Let's harness our collective knowledge to create a great resource for testing React components!

Best,<br/>
