## LocalStorage read and write

The component reads and updates a value from [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage). We test that the component renders the mocked `name` LocalStorage item.

Then we type a new name into an input, submit the form, and test that the submitted value has been updated in LocalStorage.
